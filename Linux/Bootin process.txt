Explain the booting procedure?
In Linux systems the booting is done in 6 stages.
BIOS
MBR
GRUB
Kernel
Init
Runlevel
BIOS :
BIOS stands for Basic Input and Output System. Whenever we power on the system , the system runs self 
diagnostic checks and detects all the connected input and out peripherals. This process is called POST 
(Power On Self Test). If any errors found it displays on the screen. Then BIOS locates the booting disk in 
the system and locates and loads the Primary boot loader nothing but MBR (Master Boot Record) into 
the memory. So, in simple terms the BIOS loads the MBR into memory and executes the MBR.

MBR :
MBR stands for Master Boot Record. It is located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk (it may be 
/dev/hda or /dev/sda). The size of the MBR is 512 bytes and it contains three components.
(i) Primary boot loader information and its size is 446 bytes.
(ii) Partition table information and its size is 64 bytes.
(iii) MBR validation check and its size is 2 bytes. Its main purpose is whether the MBR is valid or not.
The primary boot loader contains the secondary boot loader nothing but GRUB or LILO (in old systems). 
Then primary boot loader locates and loads the secondary boot loader into memory.
So, in simple terms the MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader.

GRUB or LILO :
GRUB stands for Grand Unified Boot loader. LILO stands for Linux Loader and is used in old Linux
systems. If we have multiple kernel images installed in our system, we can choose which one to be 
executed. GRUB displays a splash screen, waits for few seconds. If we do not enter anything, it loads the 
default kernel image as specified in the grub configuration file. GRUB has the knowledge of the file 
system (the old LILO didn't understand the system). GRUB configuration file is /boot/grub/grub.conf 
(/etc/grub.conf is a link to this). This file contains kernel and initrd images. So, in simple terms GRUB 
just loads and executes kernel and initrd images.

Kernel :
Kernel initialises itself and loads the kernel modules and mounts the root file system as specified in the 
"root=" in grub.conf and then kernel executes the /sbin/init program. Since init was the 1st program 
to be executed by Linux kernel, it has the process ID (PID) of 1. We can see this id by # ps -ef | 
grep init command. initrd stands for initial RAM Disk. initrd is used by kernel as temporary file 
system until kernel is booted and the real root the file system is mounted. It also contains necessary 
drivers compiled inside which helps it to access the hard drive partitions and other hardware.

init level :
In this init program reads the /etc/inittab file and put the system into specified run level. init identifies 
the default run level from /etc/inittab file and we can change the this default run level whenever we 
needed. We can find the default run level by # grep "initdefault" /etc/inittab command on our 
system. Normally the default run level in Linux is 3 in CLI (Command Line Interface) mode and 5 in GUI 
(Graphical User Interface)mode.
Run Level Programs :
The following run levels are available in Linux systems.
0 -----> halt or shutdown the system
1 -----> Single user mode
2 -----> Multi user without NFS
3 -----> Full multi user mode but no GUI and only CLI mode
4 -----> Unused
5 -----> Full multi user mode with GUI (X11 system)
6 -----> reboot the system
Whenever we start the Linux system is booting we can see various services getting started. Those 
services are located in different run levels programs executed from the run level directory as 
defined by our default run level. Depending on our default init level setting, the system will 
execute the programs from one of the following directories.
Run level 0 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc0.d
Run level 1 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc1.d
Run level 2 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc2.d
Run level 3 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
Run level 4 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc4.d
Run level 5 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc5.d
Run level 6 -----> /etc/rc.d/rc6.d
The above directories are also having symbolic links available for those directories under /etc/rc0.d, 
/etc/rc1.d, ....etc., So, the /etc/rc0.d is linked to /etc/rc.d/rc0.d
Booting procedure in RHEL - 7:
Upto kernel the booting process is same as the above. /boot/grub2/grub.conf is the GRUB 
configuration file in RHEL - 7. systemd is the initial process in RHEL - 7 and its process ID is 1.
linux16 read the root ( / ) file system and then initrd16process will mount the root ( / ) file system in 
read & write mode and starts the systemdprocess. And the systemd process will read the /etc/fstab 
file and mount all the file systems. Then it reads the file /etc/systemd/system/default.target file 
and brings the system into the default run level according to the scripts the processes will start or 
stop.
