Explain the locate command and how to use it?

locate always looks the locate database and not in a specific location. The data of the locate is stored in 
/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db file. If the data is not updated in locate database or the locate database 
is available or locate database is deleted, we cannot locate the files and directories. # updatedb is the 
command to update the locate database. locate database cannot be find the newly created files and 
directories. It is not recommended to use on production servers because it impacts on performance of 
the servers. So, to overcome this problem we normally use # find command on production servers.
# updatedb (to update the locate database)
# locate <file name/directory name> (to search the specified file or directory)

 directories.

# find <location><options><file or directory> (to find the specific file or directory)
