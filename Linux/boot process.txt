BIOS
--> stands for basic input / outpu system
--> IT loads and executes the MBR boot loader
--> when we turn of our system , The BIOS first perforn some integrity check of the HDD and SDD
--> then the BIOS loads and execute the boot loaded programm which can be found in master boot record
--> Once boot loader programm detcted then its load into memory and handover to the system
--> The MBR is some time in USB sticks or CD ROM
 
MBR
--> MBR is responsible for loading and executing GRUB boot loader
--> MBR is located in first sector of bootable device(/dev/hda , /dev/sda)
--> MBR also have information of GRUB
--> First 512 byes of bootable drive
--> 446 bytes(boot loader) + 64 byts(Partition Table) + 2 magic number (which is used for error detection)
--> Finaly  MBR is responsiblr for descover the bootable device and load grub boot loader into menory and transfer the control over it.


GRUB
--> GNU GRand Unified Bootloader
--> typical boot loader for modern linux systems
--> The GRUB2 configuration file is located at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
--> GRUB2 main configuration setting taken from /etc/default/grub
--> GRUB seraches the compressed kernal image file alos called as vmlinuz in the boot directory
--> GRUB loads the vmlinuz kernal image file into the memory 
--> and extract the content of the initramfs image file into the temporary , memory based file system (tmpfs)
--> The initial Ramdisk initrd is initial root file system that is mounted before the real root file sysetm.

initramfs (initial ram file system)
--->Job of this fs is to preload the block drive modules ,such as IDE ,scsi or raid so that root file system on which those module
    normally reside , can then be accessed and mounted
---> initramfs contain kernal module for all hardware that is require to boot as well as
     the initial script required to process the next stage of booting.
---> The initramfs is bound to the kernel and kernel mounts this initramfs as part of two stage boot process
---> The dracut utility created intramfs whenerver a new kernal is installed.
---> Use initrd command to view the content of the image created by dracut.

Kernal(loading the kernal)
---> the kernal start systemd/initd process with PID 1.
---> it also load the necessary driver modules from initrd image.
---> The boot loader may present the boot menu to the user or can be configured to automatically start a default operating system
---> To load linux, kernal is load together with initramfs . initramfs contain kernal module for all hardware that is require to boot as well as
     the initial script required to process the next stage of booting.
--->On RHEL 7, the initramfs contains a complete operational system (which may be used for troubleshooting purposes).

Starting SystemD
---> systemd is the first process that starts after the system boots, and is the final process that is running when the system shuts down.
---> it controls the final stages of booting and prepares the system for use. It also speeds up booting by loading services concurrently.
---> systemd reads the file linked by /etc/systemd/system/default.target (for example, /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target) to determine the default system target (equivalent to run level). The system target file defines the services that systemd starts.

Comparision of SysV Run Levels and Target Units
Run Level     Target Units       Description  
  0          runlevel0.target,   poweroff.target
Shut down and power off
1
runlevel1.target, rescue.target
Set up a rescue shell
2,3,4
runlevel[234].target, multi- user.target
Set up a nongraphical multi-user shell
5
runlevel5.target, graphical.target
Set up a graphical multi-user shell
6
runlevel6.target, reboot.target
Shut down and reboot the system
