ERROR: WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError: WinRM::WinRMAuthorizationError

Solution-: setup winrm again
->   C:\> winrm quickconfig 
press Yes
-> winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'
-> netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" profile=public protocol=tcp localport=5985 remoteip=localsubnet new remoteip=any
OR
-> winrm quickconfig 
->   winrm quickconfig -transport:https
->   winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener
->  Winrm quickconfig  --> creates a firewall exception only for the current user profile

Run on both system
 That time you will get below errors

WinRM firewall exception will not work since one of the network connection types on this machine is set to Public. Change the network connection type to either Domain or Private and try again.
-> change your network type public to private
     -->Go to Control Panel –> Network and Internet –> View Network status and tasks
       You will see the network type under each connected network
