********************************************1.Introduction to git******************************************************************** 

1.Git is an SCM-source code management tool 
2.There are two types of code management systems.
                               |
           |-------------------------------------------------------------|
         CVCS (SVL)                                                     DVCS
 
 1.Centralised version control system                   1.Distributed version control system
 2.CVCS tool used earlier before DVCS                   2."git" tool used for DVCS also "mercural" is there. 
 3.Code save from local to remote server orcentral repo 3.Code save on central repo of remote server or can be pull                                                              
 Drawback:                                                on local machine                                            
 4.If central repo got corrupt or failed data loss      4.No need to connect to internet once code pull at local machine
 5.Remote server got failed then also data loss         5.If central repo or server got failed then we will have data at local  
 6.Internet required to access central repo               machine of eache user as users pull code on daily basis to work.No data loss
 7.Speed slow as we are accessing through internet      6.It is fast and reloable.
 8.Always need to connect to netwrok to perform any     7. For Every change in code commit id given to it so it is easy to track.
   action
 9.Developer always face conflict while code merge      8.Conflict chances are less while merging code as compared to CVCS
 10.CVCS do not provie offline access.                  9.working fine in offline mode as client copies the entire repo at local machine

3.Git invented by linux torvald at 2005 1st version introduce.Earlier linux using bit-keeper control version system.
4.Git work at local repo and workspace.It is used on local machine to manage code. 
5.GitHub is a service which provide centralize storage.It work as remote server or central repo.
6.If developer want to share code with others team member then code need to be push on central server(github) in DVCS.
7.In DVCS every user has a local copy and clone of central repository.local repo has all the files and metadata present in main repo.


******************************************2.Git 3 stages of working*******************************************************************

1.Need to install git on Local machine 
2.Create directory to use git in that directory only
3.Need to run command inside created directory.
   $git init         ---it is used to initialize git  in that directory
4.post execution of above command hidden folder ./git is created inside that directory and directory will get converted
  into git repository or local repositroy.
5.Git has 3 stages.

  I) Workspace/Working directory: Code is written,edited in this directory.It is work area.
  II)Staging Area: once code wriiten then it is add in staging area where we can not do any changes in code.The code which we want to 
                   commit added in staging area.It is not mandatory to commit all the codes present in staging area.
                   It work as an intermediate stage between workspce and commit.
                          $
                             
  III)Local repository: It is finalizing the code or save the code.
                        when we commit the code uniq commit id is given to that code so it is easy to track.we can also give tag 
                        while commiting which is description or extra information about the commit.

6.Once code commited it means it is finalized and now it is ready to push on central repo (GITHUB) to  share with other user.

7.GitHub is takeover by microsoft and it chargable for private repo.so developer designed gitlab which is free version.

8.We need to create an account on GITHUB then only we can push the data from local repo.once data push then it can be accessed by
  other user also.other user working on same project can pull the data into their local machine and add the code into it.Once added 
  then user has to commit the changes into their local machine and then it is pushed on github due to this it useful avoid conflict
  of work.Also details of user for commited code is also there so it is easy to track changes done by any one. 

9.If we want to do version control maually then we have take backup of code every day that will increases storage becauses everday we 
  take backup of old as well as new added code this is not the case with git.In git incremental snapshot is taken due to which it will
  copy only newly added code as old code is already their.
10.Important terms in git:
   I)commit: It store changes in local repository.one commit-id is assigned to that change.
             commit id  is 40 alpha-numeric character and uses SHA-1 checksum concept.
             event if one dot is added then also different commit id will be changed.
             commit id is used to tracke changes in code and help to identify who changed the file.

   II)Tags: Tag is added with commit as a comment or meaningful description about that commit.

   III)snapshots:when we commit the code snapshot is created and once we do any changes in that and commit once again
                 then it will append changes in new snapshot.It is always incremental snapshot used in git.
   IV)Push: push opearion copies changes from local repo to remote or central repo
   V)Pull: pull operation copies the changes from remote to a local repo.It is used for synchronization between two repo.
   VI)Branch:code save in default "Master branch" but if we want work parallel on any project the we create branch from master.
             by using branch work can be done parrallley and after completion required branch can be merged with master.
             Each task has separate branch and finally merge all branches.Default branch is master.
11.Advantages of Git.
   I)  Free and open source
   II) Fast and small as most of operation are performed locally.
   III)Secure as it uses cryptography hash function SHA1 checksum method to name and identify objects within database.
   IV)No need of poweful hardware.
   V)branching is easy.

#git installation on local machine:

  ->yum install git -y                                        --- by default git pkg is present in linux so install with yum
  ->which git                                                 --- wheere git installed
  ->git --version                                             --- Version:2.23.3
  ->git config --global user.name "DK"                        --- It is configure so tha commit can be identified

  ->git config --list                                         ---to get the global user name and email details


#git hub account creation:

 ->https://github.com/
 ->username:dnyand
 -Create repo and copy URL

#git general commands

   Need to create directory as local machine.

 ->git init                                                   ---To initialize or convert directory into git repository
 ->touch file                                                 ---file created to write a code
 ->git status                                                 ---"untracked" file in "RED" colour will indicate data is in work space
 ->git add .                                                  ---To add code from working space to staging area
 ->git status                                                 ---data or file is shown in "GREEN" colour which indicated data is 
                                                                 track and also added in staging area
 ->git commit -m "1st commit"                                 ---to move from staging to commit
 ->git status                                                 ---once commited then it will not show anyting in working space
 ->git log                                                    ---It will give info of user who commited code,commit ID,Date & Time,tag
 ->git show commit_id                                         ---To see what code commited for that commit id
 ->git remote add origin https://github.com/dnyand/study.git  ---To add data on central repo or on github repo "origin" name given 
 ->git push -u origin master                                  ---To push code into master branch of remote or central repo it will ask
                                                                 username and password for github
 ->If file is modified then we have to follow again same procedure.add in staging then commit.
